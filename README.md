# Code Refactor
## Description
- This project was a code refactor where I was given the base code and was tasked with making sure the webpage followed accessibility standards and ensuring that their website is optimized for search engines. I modified the existing code to make sure that a certain criteria was met. It had to have semantic elements that followed logical structure independent of styling and positioning, image elements with accessible alt attributes and a concise descriptive title. This was accomplished by adding a more precise title, adding a header and footer element, making sure all images had alt attributes.
